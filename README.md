Student Record Management System

Objective: Create a CLI-based CRUD system for managing student records.
Tools :Java, VS Code/IntelliJ CE.
Deliverables: Java program with classes and menu options.

The program runs in the command line and allows users to:
Add a student (ID, Name, Marks)
View all student records
Update a student’s details
Delete a student’s record

While building this project, I explored some basic Java concepts like classes, objects, arrays, and how to use `ArrayList`.

I searched for examples and references on Google, Java tutorials, and YouTube to understand how to implement each function correctly.
